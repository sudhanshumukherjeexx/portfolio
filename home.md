### Hello, Legends 🚀

I'm Sudhanshu Mukherjee, an entrepreneur at heart and a Data Scientist from [Nagpur, The Tiger Capital of India](https://www.pridehotel.com/blog/nagpur---tiger-capital-of-india.html). 

I am currently building a platform called [R.I.D.E](https://neokai.streamlit.app/), that lets you do rapid data prototyping with just a few clicks. Upload your dataset, explore multifaceted data analytics, visualize trends, and leverage machine learning, all backed by the power of AI and a No-Code environment.

I'm pursuing my Master's in Data Science from the [University of Massachusetts](https://www.umassd.edu/). I work as a [Digital Scholarship Assistant/Instructor](https://lib.umassd.edu/dish/) and serve as a Teaching Assistant for a high-performance scientific computing class. As one of my capstone projects, I built a Python Package called [Prepup-Linux](https://pypi.org/project/prepup-linux/) that lets you perform data pre-processing directly on the terminal - [GitHub](https://github.com/sudhanshumukherjeexx/prepup-linux). 

I write blogs, vlog personal moments, and create YouTube videos. The previous line is directly proportional to Time, Mood, and Creativity.

I'm active on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudhanshumukherjeexx/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/sudhanshumukherjeexx) and aspire to become a Tech Influencer. You can reach me via [Email](mailto:sudhanshumukherjeexx@gmail.com).</p>
